# GraphQL Gateway Setup

This repository sets up a **GraphQL Gateway** service implemented in Go, which interacts with a **Redis** service for Pub/Sub messaging. The setup is containerized using **Docker** and managed with **Docker Compose**.

## Project Structure

- **GraphQL Gateway (Go)**: A GraphQL API for querying satellite position data.
- **Redis Service**: Used for Pub/Sub messaging between services.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages and orchestrates the services.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine.
- **Go** installed (if you plan to modify the Go code locally).
